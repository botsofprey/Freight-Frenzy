/**
 * <p>
 * This class encapsulates the gamepad1 and gamepad2 that the op mode gives to you.
 * Call the update function once per frame at the very beginning of the frame.
 * If update is called more than once per frame, inputs may be missed.
 * If update is not called on some frames, you may receive the same input multiple times.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The buttonHeld variables will be true if the button is held down and false otherwise.
 * The buttonPressed variables will be true on the first frame
 * the button is held and then they will switch back to false.
 * The ButtonReleased variables will be true on the first frame
 * the button is not held and then will switch back to false.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You may write to the public variables in this class,
 * however it is strongly advised to only read from
 * them as the class was not intended to handle that.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The buttonFunctions allow you to bind a function pointer or lambda expression to a button.
 * This can simplify code by reducing the amount of code in a loop
 * and the number of repetitive if statements.
 * ex:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * controller1.aFunctions.pressed(lift::upPosition);}
 * </pre>
 * or
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * controller2.xFunctions.pressed(() -> {
 *     intake.switchState(Intake.INTAKE_BUTTON);
 * });}
 * </pre>
 * </p>
